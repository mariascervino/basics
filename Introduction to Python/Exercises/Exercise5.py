# Exercise 5: Using if statements, create a variable called day, set it to
# “Tuesday”. Check to see if day is equal to “Monday” or “Tuesday”, and if it
# is, print, “Today is sunny”. If it is not, print “Today it will rain”

day = "Tuesday"

if day == "Tuesday" or day == "Monday":
    print("Today is sunny")
else:
    print("Today it will rain")
